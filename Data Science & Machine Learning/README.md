### üíæ Where it all began

With respect to computer science, my interests arose in A level study and piqued in
undergraduate study. My curiosity was initially sparked by Boston dynamics autonomous robots, they fascinated me from
a physics perspective, guiding me to consider complex issues such as continuous weight
distribution. My extracurricular endeavours led me to explore the realm of virtual reality, in
which the possibilities for simulating previously intangible physical phenomena seemed endless.

Outside academia, I have been consuming content in the subset of machine learning, facilitating
my discovery of mechanisms of artificial neural networks. The philosophy of input result
equivalency and assigning a weighting coefficient with respect to the precision, seems
synonymous to how the human brain operates, a concept that deeply excites me.
In year one of undergraduate study; I was gripped by the topic of computational statistics. The
programming of numerical methods and algorithmic solutions to physics problems provided a
tangible nature to the theory.

The application of theoretical statistics was realised in my statistical mechanics module.
The precise description of physical phenomena such as entropy via
statistical machinery was remarkable. The exposure to fundamental statistical concepts such as
Boltzmann distributions at an early stage has allowed me to grasp computational statistics
mechanisms more readily I began to recreationally study programming, constructing my own
rudimentary code emulating dice rolls in java, and building of retro video games in python. My enjoyment of computation was reflected in my high
grades in the MATLAB and Java modules, where I was able to engage in numerical methods and
object-oriented programming to program physics principles. This is where I began to develop my love for programming,
the gift of visualisation was eye-opening, to see the mathematics come to life. 

Upon progression, the study of quantum mechanics I again encountered the statistical nature of
the fundamentals of reality. My enthusiasms of statistics, calculus and physics culminated in my
development of a model describing population dynamics using quantum-field theoretic
techniques with a statistical mechanics basis. The self-organised criticality and temporal scale
invariance deployed via field-theoretic techniques allowed inclusion of stochastic fluctuations in
the population; neglected in classical models. The pragmatic application of abstract physics to
aid realistic needs was a major contributor in my decision to pursue scientific research outside
the domain of theoretical physics.

### üåê Machine learning and Data Science

This repository currently holds the large majority of my machine learning and data science work. With respect to the 
work itself, I aim to provide a pedagogical approach, with deep mathematical motivations, and rigorous computations. 
The work itself is to increase the understanding of the underlying mechanisms at hand, whilst providing an actionable instantiation
of the machinery itself. My motivation stems from bridging the gap between esoteric academic research, to pragmatic applications that 
can be employed in industry. 

The repository itself contains domains of the following nature:

Abstract: Classical population dynamics models such as the Malthusian model have been used to describe general deterministic exponential population growth. These
classical deterministic systems are restricted by, and have a strong dependency on the precision of measurement of initial conditions. This research project looks
to develop a Markovian, i.e. memory-less probabilistic system that encapsulates birth-death processes in a population to bypass these hard constraints. At present, stochastic processes that realise this classically are difficult to model and solve. The Doi-Peliti formalism provides a succinct basis for quantising, and solving these processes. This formalism has recently been applied to fields such as mathematical biology, and quantum field theory. On the basis of a budding branching process, we look to present a systematic derivation of the coherent-state path integral via intricate field-theoretic machinery, to provide analytic solutions to the birth-death processes. This will
produce a continuous population-dependent stochastic process. These are then compared to their corresponding Malthusian results. The research project generalises a stochastic process with respect to a specified master equation to advance collation, to the results derived from utilising the Doi-Peliti formalism. The results and comparisons grant an intuition of the coherent state path integral, and modelling of binary fission processes with comparison of deterministic population dynamics to population-dependent stochastic systems.
