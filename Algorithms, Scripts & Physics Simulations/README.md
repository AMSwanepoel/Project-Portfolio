üß† Brainteasers and mathematical puzzles have been an inclination of mine since a young age. Recreationally I remain up to date with following quantitative brainteasers and puzzles, such as the problems posted by Jane Street, amongst other numerical conundrums presented in statistics and Bayesian mathematics. Throughout my academic career I have always been interested in problem solving and developing an aptitude for it; A tangential branch of this would include dynamic and algorithmic solutions to problems posed in general domains. In this repository, I have composed an eclectic range of algorithms and scripts used to address dynamic programming problems, quantitative and mathematical puzzles, as well as academic implementations of useful algorithms. A comprehensive list of the scripts and algorithms themselves are as follows:

Abstract: Classical population dynamics models such as the Malthusian model have been used to describe general deterministic exponential population growth. These
classical deterministic systems are restricted by, and have a strong dependency on the precision of measurement of initial conditions. This research project looks
to develop a Markovian, i.e. memory-less probabilistic system that encapsulates birth-death processes in a population to bypass these hard constraints. At present, stochastic processes that realise this classically are difficult to model and solve. The Doi-Peliti formalism provides a succinct basis for quantising, and solving these processes. This formalism has recently been applied to fields such as mathematical biology, and quantum field theory. On the basis of a budding branching process, we look to present a systematic derivation of the coherent-state path integral via intricate field-theoretic machinery, to provide analytic solutions to the birth-death processes. This will
produce a continuous population-dependent stochastic process. These are then compared to their corresponding Malthusian results. The research project generalises a stochastic process with respect to a specified master equation to advance collation, to the results derived from utilising the Doi-Peliti formalism. The results and comparisons grant an intuition of the coherent state path integral, and modelling of binary fission processes with comparison of deterministic population dynamics to population-dependent stochastic systems.

### üåå Physics Simulations 
With respect to programming, the gift of visualisations to a Physicist is the cornerstone to intuition. The physical representation of the mathematics at hand allows for a grasp of fundamental abstract concepts more deeply by removing the veil of mystery, and illuminating mechanics or trends previously concealed. Within the repository is also a collection of simulations with respect to Physics and physical systems, written from a pedagogical approach such that one may begin at a mathematical formulation of a particular system, and follow a succession of steps to implement a given system into code, for visualisation, to aid intuitons, and satisfy curiousity. Some of the simulations include:
